# JsonDsl jupyter notebook with some examples

Created to be used as demo material at the March 2024 Kotlin meetup in Berlin for my presentatino on [json-dsl](https://github.com/jillesvangurp/json-dsl).

## Usage

Install Jupyter and the then kotlin-jupyter-kernel. If you use miniconda, this is how you can do it:

```shell
conda create --name kotlin-jupyter python=3.12
conda activate kotlin-jupyter
conda install jupyter
conda install -c jetbrains kotlin-jupyter-kernel
```

## Running

Clone this repository and then in the root directory run:

```
kotlin-jupyter
```

Your browser should open with a list of notebooks, open the jsdon-dsl examples one.
